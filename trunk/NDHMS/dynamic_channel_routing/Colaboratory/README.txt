This folder will initially be populated with a series of Google Colaboratory experiments 
using python scripting to build out the base classes and basic functionality of a 
general purpose hydraulic network solver. The general-ness of it is intended to support
a series of tests to incorporate a series of dynamic codes and compare them as potential
candidates for use as the base dynamic hydraulic engine for the NWM. 

My purpose in exposing this to GitHub is to efficiently make possible collaborative 
editing -- because there are certainly those who have more experience and expertise who
might comment on how this has been done or how it might be better done here. 

In general, as with all things related to the national water center, our goal is to save
more lives and prevent more property damage by more accurately forecasting the state of the nations
rivers and other water resources, especially with respect to floods and by getting that
information more quickly and understandably to people who can and will do something 
useful with it to those ends.
